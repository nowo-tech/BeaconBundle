## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- Initial `nowo-tech/beacon-bundle` release with DSN-based Envelope transport for Symfony Beacon.
- Automatic `kernel.exception` listener with `ignore_exceptions` support.
- Flex recipe and installation defaults centered on `BEACON_DSN`.
- Expanded documentation set for installation, configuration, usage, release, security, performance, Engram, and Spec Kit workflows.
- Demo routes covering message capture, manual exception capture, listener-triggered exceptions, ignored exceptions, fingerprints, and runtime status.

### Changed

- Documentation and examples now use Beacon-specific terminology consistently.
- README was rewritten as the canonical product entry point with DSN format, quick start, FrankenPHP, and documentation links.
- Demo app text, pages, and route matrix were aligned with BeaconBundle instead of legacy bundle wording.
